config F2FS_FS
	tristate "F2FS filesystem support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  F2FS is based on Log-structured File System (LFS), which supports
	  versatile "flash-friendly" features. The design has been focused on
	  addressing the fundamental issues in LFS, which are snowball effect
	  of wandering tree and high cleaning overhead.

	  Since flash-based storages show different characteristics according to
	  the internal geometry or flash memory management schemes aka FTL, F2FS
	  and tools support various parameters not only for configuring on-disk
	  layout, but also for selecting allocation and cleaning algorithms.

	  If unsure, say N.

config F2FS_STAT_FS
	bool "F2FS Status Information"
	depends on F2FS_FS && DEBUG_FS
	default y
	help
	  /sys/kernel/debug/f2fs/ contains information about partitions mounted as f2fs.
	  For each partition, a corresponding directory, named as its device
	  name, is provided with the following files:

	  f2fs_stat	major file system information managed by f2fs currently
	  f2fs_sit_stat	average SIT information about whole segments
	  f2fs_mem_stat	current memory footprint consumed by f2fs

	  e.g., in /sys/kernel/debug/f2fs/sdb1/

config F2FS_FS_XATTR
	bool "F2FS extended attributes"
	depends on F2FS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit
	  <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  If unsure, say N.

config F2FS_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "F2FS Access Control Lists"
	depends on F2FS_FS_XATTR
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	default y
	help
	  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  gourps beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the POSIX ACLs for
	  Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N
