* I2C DT bindings

  This is an adapter device for use in device tree cases.
  What we want to do is to add a number of I2C devices connected
  to a specified i2c adapter node, and instantiate them on
  successful cape match. Not only that, normally I2C adapters
  are disabled in the DT tree, so in that case we enable them
  first and then go about our business.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must have the form "i2c-dt"
- parent: The phandle of the i2c adapter node
- #address-cells: The same as the parent i2c adapter node
- #size-cells: The same as the parent i2c adapter node

Example:

i2c2-devices {
	compatible = "i2c-dt";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	parent = <&i2c2>;

	/* Ambient light sensor */
	tsl2550@39 {
		compatible = "tsl,tsl2550";
		reg = <0x39>;
	};

	/* Humidity Sensor */
	sht21@40 {
		compatible = "sensiron,sht21";
		reg = <0x40>;
	};

	/* Barometric pressure sensor */
	bmp085@77 {
		compatible = "bosch,bmp085";
		reg = <0x77>;
	};
};
