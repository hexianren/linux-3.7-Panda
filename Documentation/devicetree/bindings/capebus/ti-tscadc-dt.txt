* TI's TSCADC Device Tree adapter

  This is an adapter device for use in device tree cases, since the
  drivers DT bindings are not yet ready. It is bound to get away once
  they are in place. Note that there is no capebus prefix, since there's
  not really any dependence on capebus; the drivers can be moved out of
  capebus if need be.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must have the form "ti-tscadc-dt"
- ti,hwmods: Must have the form "adc_tsc" (until hwmod DT is complete)

Optional properties:
- adc-channels: Number of ADC channels the driver should provide.
- tsc-wires: Number of touchscreen wires
- tsc-x-plate-resistance: Touchscreen X plate resistance value
- tsc-steps: Touchscreen steps

Note if either adc-channels or tsc-wires are missing their respective
values are set to 0.

Example:

tscadc {
	compatible = "ti-tscadc-dt";

	ti,hwmods = "adc_tsc";

	tsc-wires = <4>;
	tsc-x-plate-resistance = <200>;
	tsc-steps = <6>;

	adc-channels = <4>;
};
