* DA8XX DT bindins

  This is an adapter device for use in device tree cases, since the
  drivers DT bindings are not yet ready. It is bound to get away once
  they are in place. Note that there is no capebus prefix, since there's
  not really any dependence on capebus; the drivers can be moved out of
  capebus if need be.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must have the form "da8xx-dt"
- ti,hwmods: Must have the form "lcdc" (until hwmod DT is complete)
- disp-pll: PLL value
- panel-type: Name of the panel type connected

Optional properties:
powerdn-gpio: GPIO controlling power

Note that the pinctrl bindings are supported.

Example:

dvi {
	compatible = "da8xx-dt";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&bone_dvi_cape_dvi_00A0_pins>;
	ti,hwmods = "lcdc";

	disp-pll = <560000000>;
	panel-type = "1024x768@60";
	powerdn-gpio = <&gpio2 7 0>;
};
