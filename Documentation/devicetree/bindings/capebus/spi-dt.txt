* SPI DT bindings

  This is an adapter device for use in device tree cases.
  What we want to do is to add a number of SPI devices connected
  to a specified spi node, and instantiate them on
  successful cape match. Not only that, normally SPI nodes
  are disabled in the DT tree, so in that case we enable them
  first and then go about our business.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must have the form "spi-dt"
- parent: The phandle of the spi node
- #address-cells: The same as the parent spi node
- #size-cells: The same as the parent spi node

Example:

spi1-devices {
	compatible = "spi-dt";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	parent = <&spi1>;

	lcd@0 {
		compatible = "adafruit,tft-lcd-1.8-red", "sitronix,st7735";
		spi-max-frequency = <8000000>;
		reg = <0>;
		spi-cpol;
		spi-cpha;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcd_pins>;
		st7735-rst = <&gpio4 19 0>;
		st7735-dc = <&gpio4 21 0>;
	};

};
