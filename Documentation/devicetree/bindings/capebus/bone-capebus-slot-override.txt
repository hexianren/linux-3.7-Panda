* Beagle bone capebus slot override bindings

The beagle bone capebus node can have slot override nodes. These nodes describe
  an override that will take place in the specified slot.
  Many boards during the prototype phase don't have an EEPROM (or are even
  wired in such a way that an eeprom cannot be added). In that case you can
  specify an override that will make everything work as if a real EEPROM was
  there.

Required properties:
- compatible: Override node must have the form "bone-capebus-slot-override"
- slot: Identifies the slot# to override.
- board-name: The cape's name as if provided by the board-name EEPROM field

Optional properties:
- version: The cape's version as if provided by the version EEPROM field.
- manufacturer: The cape's manufacturer as if provided by the manufacturer
  EEPROM field.

Example:

override@1 {
	compatible = "bone-capebus-slot-override";
	slot = <1>;
	board-name = "Adafruit 1.8 Cape";
	version = "00A0";
	manufacturer = "Adafruit";
};
