TI SOC ECAP based APWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "ti, ecap"
- ti,hwmods : Must be "ecap<n>", n being the instance number (0-based)
- #pwm-cells: On ECAP the number of cells used to specify a PWM is 3. The
  first cell specifies the per-chip index of the PWM to use, the second
  cell is the period cycle in nanoseconds and the third cell is the
  polarity of PWM output. Polarity 0 gives normal polarity and 1 gives
  inversed polarity (inverse duty cycle)

Optional properties:
- has_configspace: Some ECAP hardwares has config space memory region
  to enable clock gating to individual modules. Adding this as optional
  properties.

Note: Current implementation will fetch base address, irq and dma
from omap hwmod data base during device registration.
Future plan is to migrate hwmod data base contents into device tree
blob so that, all the required data will be used from device tree dts
file.

Example:

	ecap0: ecap@0 {
		compatible = "ti, ecap";
		ti,hwmods = "ecap0";
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
	};
Example with has_configspace:
	ecap0: ecap@0 {
		compatible = "ti, ecap";
		ti,hwmods = "ecap0";
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
		has_configspace = <1>;
	};
